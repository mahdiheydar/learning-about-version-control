# Learning about Version Control
Author: Mahdi Heydar

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is how it forces you to be well organized and take care of issues such as merge conflicts as soon as they arise.

What I like least about version control is how sometimes you can run into bugs, and it takes time to figure out what step you may have missed or whether you need to use the command line instead - this can be frustrating.
